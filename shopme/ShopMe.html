                    <h3>Computer Science Paper 1 & Paper 2</h3>
                    <h4>Theoritical Sessions</h4>
                    <p>
                        This book is a special sequel to the G.C.E Advanced Level Computer Science. 
                        The book has been written with special attention to all candidates willing 
                        to understand the concepts in Advanced Level, with the belief being 
                        “a constant solving of past examination papers drives the concept faster”.<br>
                        This book is divided into three main parts; the first part consists of past 
                        GCE paper 1 questions from 2010 to 2019, the second part consist of past GCE 
                        paper 2 questions from 2010 to 2019 and four additional regional mock exams 
                        and the third part is composed of solutions to the preceding past GCE 
                        questions which are clearly fleshed out demonstrated.<br>
                        The aim of this workbook is not for you to memorise solutions but to actually 
                        understand the concept behind each problem. That is why I emphasized on the 
                        terms “clearly fleshed out demonstrated solutions”. <hr>

                    <h3>Computer Science Paper 3 & Summarised Notes</h3>
                    <h4>Practical Sessions</h4>
                    <p>
                        This book is divided into three main parts; the first part consists of 
                        past GCE paper 3 questions from 2010 to 2020 together with sample and 
                        regional mock questions, the second part consists of proposed solutions 
                        to the preceding past GCE and past Mock questions which are clearly 
                        fleshed out demonstrated and the third part is composed of short, simple 
                        and summarised notes to accompany students during their study times.<br>
                        It is hoped that a meticulous examination of these questions (after 
                        treatment of each year session) would help candidates to secure the grades 
                        they desire and deserve. Candidates preparing for competitive entrance 
                        examinations that require knowledge of Computer Science shall also find 
                        this workbook very useful.<br><hr>

                    <p>
                        The Genuines’ team is a devotional team of God fearing computer engineering 
                        students, all from G.B.H.S Ekounou, where they completed their secondary 
                        school education and had their G.C.E Advanced Level. Now pursuing higher 
                        education in different schools but still focused in the domain of computer 
                        science, let it be Programming, Software, Architecture or whatever you could 
                        imagine as related to computer science, they are the ones who brought up this 
                        book in order to help and assist students clarify their doubts in computer science.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Vision And Ambitions</h2><hr>
                    <p>
                        The world of computer science is full of everybody else’ but only a few make a 
                        significant achievement. The thing is that, you’re smart, you can do whatever 
                        you make up your mind to do. Just that, tell yourself if anybody else can do it, 
                        then I can do it better. As a great scientist always said: “Reading is the way 
                        out of ignorance and the road to achievement” – Ben Carson <br>
                        You might not understand it now, but just know that, someday and somehow, you will.
